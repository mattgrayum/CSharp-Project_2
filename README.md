# CSharp-Project_2
This is a project assignment from my MIS15 course at California State University Sacramento. 
A simple windows form allows the user to enter Employee Type, Hours Worked, and Sales Revenue. 
The "Calculate" button then caluculates Sales Commission and Total Pay based on different rules for different types of employee.
